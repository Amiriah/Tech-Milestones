The iPhone appeared at a moment when technology allowed for greater flexibility in what materials could be used.
Touchscreen LCD displays had shrunk to a point that it finally made sense to incorporate them into cellphones. And advancements in processor speed and solid-state storage capacity enabled Apple to
